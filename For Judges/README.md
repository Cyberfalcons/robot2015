# For Judges
A place to keep stuff that we may want to show the judges at the competition. The award for software is:

Innovation in Control Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation
Celebrates an innovative control system or application of control components – electrical, mechanical, or software – to provide unique machine functions.

So anything that we might want to show the judges to help us win this award should go in here. If you have something that you think might, maybe, be helpful then throw it in! It's way better to have too much stuff and have to choose than to have nothing.
